# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Season of Code 2024
This branch is just a forked repo copy of my mentors repository.  
All my work is done on the following branches Harsh_week1, Harsh_Week3, Week4 and Fine_Grain_CNN.  
Refer to those branches for my work/code.

My Final Project, Fine Grain Classification using CNN for Bird Classification, is in the Fine_Grain_CNN branch.
