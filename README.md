### MNIST Dataset Neural Network from scratch using NumPy

Made use of the functions related to neural network explored in the Week3 assignments and applied it to the MNIST dataset which contains handwritten digits.  
Implemented one_hot_encoding, forward_prop, back_prop, update_params and gradient_descent to make the model work. Also uploaded my predicted y on the test.csv to kaggle to measure the test accarcy. And I got the following accuracies:

`Train Accuracy: 94.97%`  
`Cross validation accuracy: 92.80%`  
`Test Accuracy(on kaggle): 93.035%`  

Prediction of my model on a subset of the dataset.
