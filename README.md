# Introduction to Deep Learning

## Week 3

The first assignment for this week was Logistic Regression from scratch on cat images, to predict whether the photo is a cat or is not a cat.  
With a Logistic Regression Model I got the following accuracies.

`train accuracy: 99.04306220095694 %`  
`test accuracy: 70.0 %`

The second assignment included using a Neural Network with one hidden layer for the same task as in the above assignment. I was provided helper code and using that I implemented, forward_prop, back_prop, cost_function and update_parameters, to make the Neural Network work as intended.  
With the Neural Network, I got the following accuracies on the test data:
`Test Accuracy: 90%`

I also experimented with different sizes of the hidden layer of the neural network  
`Accuracy for 1 hidden units: 67.5 %`   
`Accuracy for 2 hidden units: 67.25 %`  
`Accuracy for 3 hidden units: 90.75 %`   
`Accuracy for 4 hidden units: 90.5 %`  
`Accuracy for 5 hidden units: 91.25 %`  
This shows that accuracy increases with increase in hidden layer units, but after a limit it might border on overfitting.
